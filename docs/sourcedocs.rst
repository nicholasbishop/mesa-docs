Source Code Documentation
=========================

`Doxygen <http://www.doxygen.org>`__ is used to automatically produce
cross-referenced documentation from the Mesa source code.

The Doxygen configuration files and generated files are not included in
the normal Mesa distribution (they're very large). To generate Doxygen
documentation, download Mesa from git, change to the ``doxygen``
directory and run ``make``.

For an example of Doxygen usage in Mesa, see a recent source file such
as
`bufferobj.c <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/tree/src/mesa/main/bufferobj.c>`__.

If you're reading this page from your local copy of Mesa, and have run
the doxygen scripts, you can read the documentation
`here <../doxygen/main/index.html>`__
